# Coding Challenges from codeguppy.com

Welcome to my first gitrepo. In these lines I will try to solve all the coding challenges from [codeguppy.com](http://codeguppy.com) in order to master and achieve simple logical thinking.

As stated in the original source: "These coding challenges are intended for beginners", and therefore the solutions will be implemented using simple programming in JavaScript language.

You can check each solution within a code playground such as [repl.it](https://repl.it), [CODEPEN](https://codepen.io) or [codeguppy](https://codeguppy.com) itself.
